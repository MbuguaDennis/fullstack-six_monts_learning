# Learning **FullStack Development**  **in six months**
## PLANS AND GOALS
 My tech vision and passion sprouted back in 2022, After completing my bachelors degree.
 Back in campus, I pursued a bachelors degree in Information Technlogy. I graduated on 17th December 
 2021.
 My journey in life has not been a straight one( ofcourse no one's journey in life is smooth.).  

 I have this burning desire to unearth my full potential in tech by serving the Almighty with my skills and talents.
